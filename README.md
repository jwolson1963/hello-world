Just an old programmer trying to become relevant again. 

I have programmed in S370 Assembler, COBOL, Ada, and professionally in PASCAL, PL/X, FORTRAN with embedded INGRES SQL, HTML, and Oracle's
DBA tools up to system 7. Yes, I took a long hiatus and am now teaching myslef to teach programming in Scratch, Python, and Java and C++
or possibly in time, Apple's Swift.
